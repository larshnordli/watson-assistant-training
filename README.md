Try experimenting with ordering multiple pizzas in the same sentence.

### Optional assignment
If you have time or you want an extra challenge:
- Connect the chatbot to a Cloud Function in IBM Cloud (serverless computing)
- The cloud function can use another Watson Service (f.ex. Tone Analyzer or Natural Language Processing)
